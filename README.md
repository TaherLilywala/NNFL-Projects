# NNFL-Projects
Various Projects done as Part of the Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic Coursework

These include:
1. CNN To Classify Facial Expressions- Used Keras Convolutional Networks, data augmentation and ReduceLROnPlateau function to
classify facial expression images into 7 categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
2. Human Activity Recognition with RNN- Used various RNN implementations to predict Human activity from given sensor data and put them
into one of six categories: Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Lying.
3. Image Colorisation using a Convolutional Auto-Encoder- Trained a model to color grayscale images using the eponymous method.
